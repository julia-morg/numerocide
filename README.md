# numerocide

Numerocide is a strategic puzzle game where your goal is to clear a 9-cell wide grid filled with random numbers. To win, you must remove numbers that are either identical or sum up to 10, but thereâ€™s a twist: the numbers can only be removed if no obstacles stand between them. This means they need to be adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or in a line once intervening numbers have been cleared. Additionally, you can eliminate the first and last numbers in a sequence if they are equal or their sum equals 10.
